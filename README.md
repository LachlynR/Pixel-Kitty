## How to customise the color of the kitty

** Setup: **

- The styling of the kitty is stored in the style.scss file.
- If you are using VS Code as your editor you will need to install the Live Sass Compiler (by Ritwick Dey) extension. (Ctrl + Shift + x shortcut to extensions marketplace).
- Clone or download the files by clicking on the green clone or download button [here](https://github.com/LachlynR/Pixel-Kitty)
- Open the style.scss file in VS Code and down the bottom there will be a little thing that says Watch Sass, click on that and a Live Sass Compile terminal window will pop up.
- If you do not see the little Watch Sass button down the bottom of VS Code, Press F1 or Ctrl+Shift+P and type "Live Sass: Watch Sass" and click on it.

** Editing kitty color **

- The colors of the kitty are stored in variables called $white, $l_gray, $d_gray, $pink, $black and $background.
- To change the primary color of the kitty, change the color of the $l_gray variable ($l_gray: YourColor;).
- To change the secondary color of the kitty (so like the stripes), change the color of the $d_gray color.
- To change the white parts of the kitty, change the $white color.
- Finally to change the pink part (in the ears), change the $pink color.
